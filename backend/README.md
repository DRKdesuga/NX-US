# üéß Nexus Backend ‚Äì Java Spring Boot API

This project is the backend for **Nexus**, a smart assistant application currently under development.  
It provides endpoints to interact with **Spotify**, **OpenAI GPT**, and more features coming soon.

Built with **Spring Boot**, this REST API is designed to be modular, extensible, and easy to integrate with a frontend.

## üöß Project Status

> **This project is still under active development.**  
We are gradually implementing and testing one feature at a time.  
The backend is cleanly layered (controller ‚Üí service ‚Üí dto/errors) to ease future expansion.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Run

1. Clone the repository  
2. Add your credentials to `application.properties`  
3. Run the app using your IDE or:
```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

- You can also use Docker, make sure Docker and Docker Compose are installed.

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```
‚úÖ Notes:
- The Dockerfile builds the app using maven:3.9.4-eclipse-temurin-21 and runs it using eclipse-temurin:21-jdk-alpine.

- The application.properties file must be baked into the image under src/main/resources/. Make sure it's correctly copied before the mvn package phase.

- You can also mount your application.properties from the host using a Docker volume if needed.

4. Visit Swagger UI:  
[http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html)

## üìå Notes

- The backend does not store tokens or sessions yet ‚Äî all tokens are passed in requests.  
- All responses are wrapped in well-structured DTOs.  
- This is the backend only ‚Äî the frontend (Angular) is still under development.
